# capuchin-interp

Capuchin is a compiler for the Monkey programming language, written entirely in C. The implementation is based on Thorsten Ball's followup book ['Writing A Compiler In Go'](https://https://compilerbook.com/).
The lexer and parser implementations have been reused from the interpreter implemenation['capuchin-interp'](https://github.com/ConstantinNicula/capuchin-interp).
### How does  it work?
TO DO: 

## Building

The following make commands are provided: 
- `make clean` 
- `make test` - run test cases and produce report 
- `make repl` - build the REPL
